1. Summary

4-6 sentences summarizing the most important aspects of your model and analysis, such as:

How you spent your time (Eg. what proportion on feature engineering vs. machine learning?)
Your most important insight into the data
The most important features
The training method(s) you used
The tool(s) you used
2. Features Selection / Extraction

What were the most important features? *
How did you select features?
Did you make any important feature transformations?
Did you find any interesting interactions between features?
Did you use external data?
*We suggest you provide:

a variable importance plot showing the 10-20 most important features and
partial plots for the 3-5 most important features
If this is not possible, you should provide a list of the most important features.

3. Training Method(s)

What training methods did you use?
Did you ensemble the models?
If you did ensemble, how did you weight the different models?
4. Simple Features and Methods

Many customers are happy to trade off model performance for simplicity. With this in mind:

Is there a subset of features that would get 90-95% of your final performance? Which features? *
What model that was most important? *
What would the simplified model score?
*Try and restrict your simple model to fewer than 10 features and one training method.

5. Interesting findings

What was the most important trick you used?
What do you think set you apart from others in the competition?
Did you find any interesting relationships in the data that don't fit in the sections above?
6. Background on you/your team

If part of a team, please answer these questions for each team member. For larger teams (3+), please give shorter responses.

What was your background prior to entering this challenge?
Did you have any prior experience that helped you succeed in this competition?
What made you decide to enter this competition?
How much time did you spend on the competition?
If part of a team, how did you decide to team up?
If you competed as part of a team, who did what?
